                    <h3 class="subtitle">All the things that you see on your smartphones, computers, smartwatch, telivions are created by programming. 
                        The way we do programming, is by talking to the machine and for talking we obviously need a language.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> You got it. That's why we have programming languages.
                        Programming languages differs by what kind of 
                        program we have to write for example if we want to create a website we generally use something called html and javascript, or if we want to create a app for your smartphone
                        we generally use java(for android) or swift(for iphones). So basically you can say programming is different based on the environment.

                          var dots = document.getElementById("dots");
                          var moreText = document.getElementById("more");
                          var btnText = document.getElementById("myBtn");
                        
                          if (dots.style.display === "none") {
                            dots.style.display = "inline";
                            btnText.innerHTML = "Read more"; 
                            moreText.style.display = "none";
                          } else {
                            dots.style.display = "none";
                            btnText.innerHTML = "Read less"; 
                            moreText.style.display = "inline";
                          }
                        }

                        <h2 class="title">What are programming languages?</h2>
                    <h3 class="subtitle">Programming languages are of course language but of special kind. And each programming language has its own speciality. Some are fast, some are slow
                        some are functional some are object oriented(don't get confused, this is just a style), some are loved, some are hated.
                        <br>
                        I think you have got the idea for programming now.
                    </h3>
                    <br>

                    <h2 class="title">Now you want to learn programming or you want someone to learn programming...</h2>
                    <h3 class="subtitle">If yes!, then you have come to the right place. Okay, let's keep it simple, let's suppose
                        if we want to learn to play football, we must be able to run first. So basically everything requires some prerequisite to learn. So do the programming.
                        But we saw that programming can be of different types so the prerequisite will differ but one thing is common across all, that is the ability to read and understand English(for Indian language speakers, cause documentation, white papers, research papers, programming books, syntax are all in english), and to do simple math. 
                        <br>

                        <br>
                    <h2 class="title">Let's talk about where you will get the resources.</h2>
                    <h3 class="subtitle">The programming community or coding community is truly one of the most helpful community of the planet. The best resources available to learn programming are available for free.
                        Not only the resources even the tools are free of cost and this is important for development of new ideas and innovation, for example <br>
                         The best universities across the world provide their courses free of cost, like MIT, Stanford. 
                         <br>
                         So the conclusion is basically you don't need to spend your tonnes of money to learn programming unless you are getting a formal education or you want to join a bootcamp.
                         <br>
                         If you have a laptop, the other thing you need is just time.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </h3>
                    <h2 class="title">Before I proceed further I want to smash some truth to your face, if you are here for your child(you can skip this if not)</h2>
                    <h3 class="subtitle">
                        But first we need to understand the advertising psychology tricks, which are used to manipulate your thinking just for money, and eventually make you to push your child 
                        in the rat race thinking if your child will not learn programming from a young age, he/she will lag behind. 
                        <br>
                        If you want your 8th grader to do programming and get something out of it, as company advertise is nearly impossible, Unless you think HTML is programming.If your child loves problem solving and still you want to shove your 
                        child under pressure here are some <a href="link.html" style="text-decoration-color: blue;">resources</a>  at least he/she can do with his/her own pace.
                        <br>
                        It won't be a exgerration if I will say that spending money to learn to code is utterly stupid.
